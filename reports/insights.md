- The platform shows a **steady revenue stream** from completed rides, though cancellations remain a small but notable fraction of total bookings.

### 5. Trends & Patterns
- **Daily ride trends** show steady demand with fluctuations likely tied to weekdays vs. weekends.  
- **Monthly rides** are stable (5,000‚Äì5,600 per month) with minor variations, showing a reliable usage base.

- **Weekdays dominate ride volume**, with Wednesday and Thursday being the busiest, while weekends see comparatively fewer rides.  
- Distance vs. rating analysis:  
  - Very short rides (0‚Äì2 km) and long rides (10+ km) have slightly **better ratings (avg 3)**.  
  - Mid-distance rides (2‚Äì10 km) received **lower average ratings (2)**, suggesting possible dissatisfaction due to pricing, time, or service quality at this range.

## üèÅ Conclusion
The ride-sharing platform demonstrates **consistent demand and revenue stability**, supported by a broad rider base and diverse fleet. However, **customer satisfaction and mid-distance ride experience are key areas for improvement**.

- Fleet optimization with more **mid-capacity vehicles** could better match demand patterns.  
- Monitoring **peak demand hours** enables targeted driver allocation, reducing cancellations and wait times.  

Overall, the platform is well-positioned for growth, but **improving satisfaction and retention will be critical for long-term success**.
