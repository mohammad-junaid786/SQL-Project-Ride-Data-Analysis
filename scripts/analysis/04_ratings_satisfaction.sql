Ratings & Satisfaction
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - Analyze ratings and satisfaction to answer key questions:
        1. What is the average rider rating given to drivers?
        2. Which riders give the most ratings (top 10 by count)?
        3. What are the distribution patterns of ratings (1â€“5)?
        4. Which drivers received the most ratings (top 10 by count)?
        5. What is the trend of average ratings over time (month-by-month, 2024)?

Tables Used:
    - clean_ratings
    - clean_rides
    - clean_drivers
    - clean_riders

Relevant Columns:
    - rating_value, rated_at, ride_id, user_id, name, driver_id
Notes:
    - Some questions from the original brief (ride_type, wait_time) are omitted because
      the dataset does not contain ride_type or wait_time columns.
